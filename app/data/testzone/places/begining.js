<p>
The curtain raises on a new adventure ...
<p>
I had already traveled a great distance, by plane ğŸ›©, then river boat â›µ,
 and most recently in a beaten up old truck ğŸš› which rattled and banged along forest trails.
<p>
And now, the rough noise of the engine dwindles through thick follage, and I am left standing alone ğŸš¶.
