const foulManor_prose = `A deep gloom hangs in the air as you approach Foul Manor from the deserted country road.
<p>
A lone crow caws from the branch of a dark withered tree, its naked limbs twisted by the cruel cutting wind.
<p>
Drawing your collar tigher round your neck you reach out and bang on the heavy wooden doors with a large brass knocker.
<p>
The thump thump thump of your knocking echos sonourosly within and the door creaks ominously open.
